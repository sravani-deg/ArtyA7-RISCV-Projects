# Arty A7 - RISC-V Projects

This repository contains my learning projects related to RISC-V soft-core processors on the Arty A7 FPGA board.

## Project 1: Blinking LED with PicoRV32

### Overview
A simple test to blink LEDs on Arty A7 using a soft-core RISC-V processor called PicoRV32. This is my first hands-on exploration of RISC-V on FPGAs.

### Tools Used
- Vivado Design Suite
- Arty A7 FPGA Board
- VHDL (base logic)
- PicoRV32 (GitHub core)

### Learnings
- How to synthesize and implement PicoRV32 on Arty A7
- How to blink an LED using memory-mapped I/O
- Basic RISC-V toolchain understanding

## Project 2: UART Communication (Upcoming)

Stay tuned for the next mini project! ðŸ˜Š
